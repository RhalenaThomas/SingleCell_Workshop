# How to make an object from the ParseBio or any non 10X input

To make the Seurat object you need  
1. An expression matrix  
2. A file with the barcodes to add to the matrix  
3. A file with the features (gene names in our case)  


```{r}

#1. define all your file names
# these are obviously not the real file names
matrixfile <- "pathway/DGE_filtered/matrix.mtx"
metafilepath <- "pathway/DGE_filtered/barcodes_other_sample_info.csv"
featuresfile <- "pathway/DGE_filtered/gene_info.csv"


# make the expression matrix 
# Seurat expects the matrix file to be as specific format with the barcodes and features as column and row names
# this is not the case for Parse Data and maybe not for other companies either 

# I will over this when looking at the outputs
  
expression_matrix <- ReadMtx(
  mtx = matrixfile, 
  cells = metafilepath, 
  features = featuresfile, 
  cell.column = 1,              # defining the column with the barcodes
  feature.column = 2,           # defining the column with the genes
  cell.sep = ",",               # define the separation
  feature.sep = ",",            # define the separation
  skip.cell = 1, 
  skip.feature = 1, 
  mtx.transpose = TRUE          
)


# once you have made this matrix you can use CreateSeuratObject
# I will have explained the matrix generation 
# you could explain this general function that works for all input types as long as you have the correct format of matrix 
seurat_object <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = expression_matrix, min.cells = 1, min.features = 10)


# for parse we add in sample and well info into the seurat object
# the barcodes and genes are in the matrix and already in the object
# It might not be necessary to mention this 
metadata.parse <- read.csv(metafilepath, row.names = 1)
seurat_object <- AddMetaData(seurat_object, metadata= metadata.parse)



```

* Other types of RNA and non-coding RNA

^RNA (starts with RNA) = Any name that starts with "RNA"
General or miscellaneous RNA entries not further classified. Rare in naming but may be present in some annotation sets.

^MIR (starts with MIR) = MicroRNA (miRNA)
Small non-coding RNAs (~22 nt) involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, often by binding to the 3' UTR of mRNAs.

RNU[0-9]+ (contains RNU followed by any number) = Entries like RNU1, RNU6-1, etc.
Stands for: RNA, U-rich small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)
Function: Components of the spliceosome, important for pre-mRNA splicing.

^TRNA (starts with TRNA) =  TRNA-ALA, TRNA-LEU, etc.
Stands for: Transfer RNA (tRNA)
Function: Adaptor molecules that bring amino acids to the ribosome during translation.

^SNOR[RD] (starts with SNOR followed by R or D) = SNORD and SNORR entries
Stands for: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)
Function: Involved in modifying rRNA (methylation or pseudouridylation), important for ribosome biogenesis.


NR_ (has NR_ in the name) = Matches: RefSeq IDs starting with NR_ (e.g., NR_003285)
Stands for: Non-coding RNA in the RefSeq database

LINC (name contains LINC) = Gene names like LINC00152, LINC00473, etc.
Stands for: Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNA
Function: These are lncRNAs transcribed from regions between protein-coding genes. They often regulate gene expression through chromatin remodeling, transcriptional interference, or miRNA sponging.

HOTAIR
Matches: The HOTAIR gene specifically
Stands for: HOX Transcript Antisense RNA
Function: A well-known lncRNA that regulates gene expression by guiding chromatin-modifying complexes. It's often overexpressed in cancer and involved in metastasis.

-AS = Gene names ending or containing -AS (e.g., FOXC2-AS1)
Stands for: Antisense RNA
Function: Transcribed from the opposite strand of a coding gene; can regulate the sense transcript via RNA interference, transcriptional collision, or epigenetic mechanisms.

-DT = Gene names like FOXC1-DT, HOXB-AS3-DT
Stands for: Divergent Transcript
Function: Often transcribed in the opposite direction from a promoter region, potentially regulating neighboring genes in cis.

nNC <- length(nonCoding)

# combine transcript names to filter out specified MALAT1 to remove
to_filter_out <- c(other_RNA, nonCoding,"MALAT1")

# I don't filter out genes from my main RNA matrix
# I filter separately and add a second layer BUT you could filter directly the seurat object

A fun function to check expression patterns
```{r}

get_exp_data_from_seu <- function(seu_obj, gene_vector, assay = "RNA", layer = "counts") {
  # Extract expression matrix (genes = rows, cells = columns)
  exp_mat <- Seurat::GetAssayData(seu_obj, assay = assay, layer = layer)
  
  # Check that the genes exist in the Seurat object
  gene_vector <- gene_vector[gene_vector %in% rownames(exp_mat)]
  
  if (length(gene_vector) == 0) {
    stop("None of the specified genes were found in the Seurat object.")
  }

  # Subset matrix to selected genes (rows)
  subset_mat <- exp_mat[gene_vector, , drop = FALSE]

  # Compute statistics per gene (across all cells, i.e., across columns)
  gene_stats <- data.frame(
    Gene = gene_vector,
    Mean = apply(subset_mat, 1, mean),
    Min = apply(subset_mat, 1, min),
    Max = apply(subset_mat, 1, max),
    Variance = apply(subset_mat, 1, var)
  )

  print(gene_stats)
  # return(gene_stats) # Uncomment to return instead of print
}

# choose any genes to get summary data

get_exp_data_from_seu(seu, gene_vector = c("RNASET2","PINK1-AS","MAP2","MALAT1"))

More gene expression exploration 

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

plot_top_expressed_genes <- function(seu_obj, n = 10, assay = "RNA", layer = "data") {
  # Extract expression matrix (genes = rows, cells = columns)
  exp_mat <- GetAssayData(seu_obj, assay = assay, layer = layer)
  
  # Compute average expression per gene
  avg_expr <- rowMeans(exp_mat)

  # Create data frame and select top n
  top_genes <- sort(avg_expr, decreasing = TRUE)[1:n]
  df <- data.frame(
    Gene = factor(names(top_genes), levels = names(top_genes)),
    AverageExpression = top_genes

Look at the distribution of a specific gene

```{r}
# where bins is the number of bins to divide the data into 

plot_gene_expression_histogram <- function(seu_obj, gene, assay = "RNA", layer = "data", bins = 30) {
  # Extract expression matrix
  exp_mat <- GetAssayData(seu_obj, assay = assay, layer = layer)
  
  # Check if gene exists
  if (!gene %in% rownames(exp_mat)) {
    stop(paste("Gene", gene, "not found in Seurat object."))
  }
  
  # Extract expression vector
  expr_values <- exp_mat[gene, ]
  
  # Create data frame for plotting
  df <- data.frame(Expression = expr_values)

  # Plot histogram
  ggplot(df, aes(x = Expression)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = bins, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(
      title = paste("Expression Histogram for", gene),
      x = "Expression Level",
      y = "Number of Cells"
    )
}

plot_gene_expression_histogram(seu, layer = "counts", gene = "MALAT1", bins = 50)

```

```{r}
plot_gene_expression_histogram(seu, layer = "counts", gene = "RNASET2", bins = 30)
