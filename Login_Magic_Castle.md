You will now see a jupyter notebook and should see a terminal

In the terminal

```
ls

```

Is there a "R" that is blue?  

```
rm -r R

```

Now you have removed the R folder made by the notebook
Now we will link to the R library with libraries installed

```
ln -s projects/def-sponsor00/R

```

Look to see if you have an R folder again

```
ls
```

You should see the teal R Folder

Now is the side - search "studio"
Select "load"  for R 4.4.0

Now press the + tab
Now click the R studio 
New tab will open and there should be no error

Projects/defâ€¦../Moein/ scroll down for the workbook and open that workbook!
